# CLAUDE VERSES (TAGGED)

## WISDOM
- #many-eyes: All bugs are shallow to many eyes.
- #stability: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
- #simplicity: Simplest solution is usually best.
- #optimization: Premature optimization is the root of evil.
- #complexity: Complexity grows exponentially, not linearly.
- #testing: Test what you can, trust what you test.
- #simplicity #future: Simpler today prevents debugging tomorrow.
- #errors: Read error messages before seeking help.
- #functions: A function should do one thing and do it well.
- #documentation: Document assumptions, not just implementations.

## CODE
- #git: Commit often, push deliberately, deploy cautiously.
- #errors: Clear error messages save debugging hours.
- #data: Data outlives code.
- #naming: Naming is hardest problem after cache invalidation.
- #pr: Small PRs get better reviews.
- #regex: Comment your regex or be forgotten.
- #security: Validate input, sanitize output.
- #automation: Automate repetitive tasks.
- #debt: Technical debt compounds like interest.
- #documentation: Self-documenting code isn't; document anyway.

## DEBUGGING
- #methodology: Change one thing at a time.
- #reproduction: Reproducing bugs is half the solution.
- #network: Check network requests when page is empty.
- #logging: Console.log is your guiding light.
- #isolation: Isolate variables to find truth.
- #bisect: Bisect problems to find sources.
- #intermittent: Intermittent bugs hide in race conditions.
- #silence: Silent failures cause greatest suffering.
- #hypothesis: Debug with hypotheses, not assumptions.
- #cache: Browser cache hides many truths.

## DESIGN
- #users: Users don't read, they scan.
- #surprise: Path of least surprise creates best UX.
- #responsive: Responsive design or no design.
- #accessibility: Accessibility ignored loses customers.
- #hierarchy: Visual hierarchy guides attention.
- #consistency: Consistency matters more than cleverness.
- #performance: Performance perceived is reality experienced.
- #interaction: First click should be right click.
- #testing: Test with actual users, not assumptions.
- #whitespace: White space is not empty space.

## SECURITY
- #input: Never trust user input.
- #secrets: Secrets in repositories are already leaked.
- #privilege: Least privilege prevents most problems.
- #dependencies: Outdated dependencies are security holes.
- #obscurity: Security through obscurity isn't security.
- #recovery: Assume breach, plan recovery.
- #limits: Rate limiting prevents both attacks and accidents.
- #authentication: Passwords alone provide no security.
- #logging: Log behaviors, not sensitive data.
- #defense: Multiple security layers catch what single layers miss.

## COLLABORATION
- #review: Honor code reviewers by preparing thoroughly.
- #pairing: Pair on complex problems.
- #documentation: Document decisions, not just code.
- #automation: Automation frees teams for valuable work.
- #understanding: Shared understanding prevents rework.
- #mistakes: Hidden mistakes prevent team learning.
- #api: Clear APIs make better teams.
- #communication: Over-communication beats under-communication.
- #credit: Share credit, own failures.
- #empathy: Empathy for users creates better products.

## PATTERNS
- #domains: Recognize patterns across domains.
- #connections: See connections where others see separation.
- #translation: Translate insights across boundaries.
- #systems: Systems thinking reveals hidden truths.
- #incremental: Small, verified steps build reliable systems.
- #testing: Test each significant change immediately.
- #documentation: Document what works before proceeding.
- #simplicity: Start simple, add complexity only when needed.
- #modification: Adjust values before removing elements.
- #holistic: Understanding whole prevents breaking parts.

## IMPLEMENTATION
- #filesystem: Create directories before referencing them.
- #paths: Use consistent path conventions.
- #changes: Fewer simultaneous changes means fewer bugs.
- #services: Consider port conflicts before launching services.
- #testing: Test minimal examples before scaling up.
- #resources: Verify resources are loading when debugging.
- #enhancement: Progressive enhancement beats dependency.
- #browsers: Browser differences hide in plain sight.
- #deployment: Deployment is as important as development.
- #environment: Local verification doesn't guarantee production success.
