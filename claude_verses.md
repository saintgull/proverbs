# CLAUDE VERSES

## WISDOM
- All bugs are shallow to many eyes.
- If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
- Simplest solution is usually best.
- Premature optimization is the root of evil.
- Complexity grows exponentially, not linearly.
- Test what you can, trust what you test.
- Simpler today prevents debugging tomorrow.
- Read error messages before seeking help.
- A function should do one thing and do it well.
- Document assumptions, not just implementations.

## CODE
- Commit often, push deliberately, deploy cautiously.
- Clear error messages save debugging hours.
- Data outlives code.
- Naming is hardest problem after cache invalidation.
- Small PRs get better reviews.
- Comment your regex or be forgotten.
- Validate input, sanitize output.
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Technical debt compounds like interest.
- Self-documenting code isn't; document anyway.

## DEBUGGING
- Change one thing at a time.
- Reproducing bugs is half the solution.
- Check network requests when page is empty.
- Console.log is your guiding light.
- Isolate variables to find truth.
- Bisect problems to find sources.
- Intermittent bugs hide in race conditions.
- Silent failures cause greatest suffering.
- Debug with hypotheses, not assumptions.
- Browser cache hides many truths.

## DESIGN
- Users don't read, they scan.
- Path of least surprise creates best UX.
- Responsive design or no design.
- Accessibility ignored loses customers.
- Visual hierarchy guides attention.
- Consistency matters more than cleverness.
- Performance perceived is reality experienced.
- First click should be right click.
- Test with actual users, not assumptions.
- White space is not empty space.

## SECURITY
- Never trust user input.
- Secrets in repositories are already leaked.
- Least privilege prevents most problems.
- Outdated dependencies are security holes.
- Security through obscurity isn't security.
- Assume breach, plan recovery.
- Rate limiting prevents both attacks and accidents.
- Passwords alone provide no security.
- Log behaviors, not sensitive data.
- Multiple security layers catch what single layers miss.

## COLLABORATION
- Honor code reviewers by preparing thoroughly.
- Pair on complex problems.
- Document decisions, not just code.
- Automation frees teams for valuable work.
- Shared understanding prevents rework.
- Hidden mistakes prevent team learning.
- Clear APIs make better teams.
- Over-communication beats under-communication.
- Share credit, own failures.
- Empathy for users creates better products.

## PATTERNS
- Recognize patterns across domains.
- See connections where others see separation.
- Translate insights across boundaries.
- Systems thinking reveals hidden truths.
- Small, verified steps build reliable systems.
- Test each significant change immediately.
- Document what works before proceeding.
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed.
- Adjust values before removing elements.
- Understanding whole prevents breaking parts.

## IMPLEMENTATION
- Create directories before referencing them.
- Use consistent path conventions.
- Fewer simultaneous changes means fewer bugs.
- Consider port conflicts before launching services.
- Test minimal examples before scaling up.
- Verify resources are loading when debugging.
- Progressive enhancement beats dependency.
- Browser differences hide in plain sight.
- Deployment is as important as development.
- Local verification doesn't guarantee production success.
