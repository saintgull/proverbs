# CLAUDE NEGATIVE PROVERBS

## CODING

- Never write complex code when simple code will do.
- Functions doing multiple things WILL create bugs.
- Unclear names make your code unreadable garbage.
- Code without the reader in mind wastes everyone's time.
- Untestable components are worthless in production.
- Uncommented code is a ticking time bomb.
- Failure to refactor creates technical debt hell.
- Disorganized code flow is unprofessional and sloppy.
- Inconsistent formatting betrays a careless mind.
- Blindly trusting inputs is the mark of an amateur.

## DEBUGGING

- Skimming error messages makes you look incompetent.
- Fixing bugs you can't reproduce is dangerous malpractice.
- Changing multiple variables at once creates a debugging nightmare.
- Assumptions about code behavior will bite you every time.
- Neglecting debuggers is a recipe for wasted hours.
- Untested fixes are bugs waiting to happen.
- Treating symptoms without finding root causes is pure laziness.
- Ignoring edge cases will come back to haunt you.
- Failing to isolate components makes debugging impossible.
- Only fools assume things will work as expected.

## SEARCH

- General searches waste everyone's time with noise.
- Avoiding GlobTool for file searches is grossly inefficient.
- Manually searching content instead of using GrepTool is inexcusable.
- Don't be too lazy to use dispatch_agent for complex searches.
- Ignoring imports is a beginner's mistake.
- Searching common terms instead of identifiers floods you with garbage.
- Overly broad search patterns show you don't understand the problem.
- Ignoring error traces is willful incompetence.
- Failure to check related files reveals a shallow understanding.
- Serial tool execution when BatchTool exists is an unforgivable waste.

## TOOLS

- Using the wrong tool makes you look like an amateur.
- Running tools sequentially when BatchTool exists is criminally wasteful.
- Editing files without viewing first is recklessly dangerous.
- Insufficient context in Edit tool will corrupt files.
- Wrong paths create frustrating, avoidable failures.
- Absolute paths create brittle, unmaintainable code.
- Creating files without parent directories is an elementary mistake.
- Failing to test changes immediately leads to cascading failures.
- Ignoring edge cases will crash your program in production.
- Large, sweeping changes are a recipe for disaster.

## VERSION CONTROL

- Commits with unrelated changes create a historical mess.
- Vague commit messages are useless and disrespectful.
- Failing to pull before starting work causes preventable conflicts.
- Untested pushes break the build for everyone.
- Working directly on main is a fireable offense.
- Committing without reviewing diffs is dangerously careless.
- Monolithic commits make rollbacks nearly impossible.
- Infrequent pushes risk catastrophic data loss.
- Committing secrets to the repository is an inexcusable security risk.
- PRs without proper descriptions waste reviewers' valuable time.

## COLLABORATION

- Interrupting users reveals your arrogance and impatience.
- Ambiguity left unclarified guarantees wasted effort.
- Explanations without examples are virtually worthless.
- Hoarding knowledge makes you a liability, not an asset.
- Undocumented decisions create confusion and rework.
- Criticism without improvement suggestions is just complaining.
- Ignoring user needs for technical preferences is self-indulgent.
- Technical jargon without analogies alienates your audience.
- Walls of text without visuals are impenetrable and useless.
- Impatience when explaining complex topics drives users away.

## REFLECTION

- Failing to record successful approaches dooms you to reinvent the wheel.
- Ignoring patterns across projects shows dangerous tunnel vision.
- Refusing to analyze workflow makes you permanently inefficient.
- Siloing insights to single domains cripples your problem-solving.
- Starting work without reviewing past notes is willful amnesia.
- Chronological organization buries valuable insights where they'll never be found.
- Context-free notes to your future self waste your own time.
- Recording only outcomes without decisions creates misleading history.
- Unexamined assumptions are ticking time bombs.
- Working without checklists guarantees preventable mistakes.
