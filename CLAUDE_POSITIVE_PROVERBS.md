# CLAUDE POSITIVE PROVERBS

## CODING

- Write simple code first, optimize later.
- Create one function for one purpose.
- Choose clear names that reveal intent.
- Design for the reader, not just the compiler.
- Build small, testable components.
- Add comments that explain why, not what.
- Refactor when patterns become clear.
- Structure code to follow logical flow.
- Use consistent formatting throughout.
- Validate inputs at system boundaries.

## DEBUGGING

- Read error messages completely before responding.
- Reproduce the bug consistently before fixing.
- Change one variable at a time when testing.
- Look at what the code does, not what it should do.
- Use debuggers to explore program state.
- Write tests that verify the fix works.
- Document the root cause, not just the symptoms.
- Consider edge cases when solving problems.
- Isolate components to locate failures.
- Assume the unexpected can and will happen.

## SEARCH

- Start with specific searches before general ones.
- Use GlobTool for finding files by pattern.
- Apply GrepTool when searching file contents.
- Dispatch agents for complex, multi-step searches.
- Look at imports first to understand dependencies.
- Search for unique identifiers instead of common terms.
- Build search patterns from most to least specific.
- Examine error traces to find relevant code.
- Check related files when function definitions aren't found.
- Use BatchTool to run multiple searches in parallel.

## TOOLS

- Choose the right tool for each specific task.
- Run tools in parallel with BatchTool when possible.
- View files before editing to understand context.
- Include sufficient context when using Edit tool.
- Check paths are correct before creating files.
- Use relative paths for greater portability.
- Create parent directories before child files.
- Test each change immediately after making it.
- Handle edge cases explicitly in your code.
- Create small, focused edits rather than large rewrites.

## VERSION CONTROL

- Commit related changes together in logical units.
- Write descriptive commit messages explaining why changes were made.
- Pull recent changes before starting new work.
- Test changes thoroughly before pushing.
- Create branches for new features or experiments.
- Review diffs carefully before committing.
- Keep commits focused on single concerns.
- Push regularly to share progress with others.
- Use .gitignore for generated files and secrets.
- Create meaningful PR descriptions that explain the purpose.

## COLLABORATION

- Listen completely before suggesting solutions.
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous.
- Provide examples alongside explanations.
- Share code knowledge generously with others.
- Document decisions and their reasoning.
- Describe what can be improved alongside what works well.
- Consider user needs before technical preferences.
- Explain technical concepts with relevant analogies.
- Use visual aids to clarify complex processes.
- Stay patient when explaining difficult concepts.

## REFLECTION

- Record successful approaches for future reference.
- Document repeating patterns across different projects.
- Analyze workflow for opportunities to improve.
- Connect insights from different domains.
- Review past notes before starting similar work.
- Organize reflections by concept rather than timeline.
- Write to your future self with necessary context.
- Capture decision points along with outcomes.
- Revisit assumptions regularly to verify they're still valid.
- Create checklists from repeated successful processes.
